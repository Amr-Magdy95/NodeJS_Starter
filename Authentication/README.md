- User Registeration
  - we receive name, email, pw, etc from client be it front-end or postman
  - we check whether those fields are valid -- VALIDATION
  - we check whether the user is already registered
  - IF NOT, We return a bad request error
  - IF So,
    - Create User
    - Hash password, suggested approach --> userSchema.pre("save", hashpw_fn)
      - using bcryptjs
    - we create an access token for the user using jwt -- userSchema.methods.createToken
    - we send the response back to the user with the token included
- User Login
  - We receive email/id/phone_num and password from the user
  - we check whether those fields are valid or non-empty -- VALIDATION
  - we check whether the email is registered in the db
    - IF NOT, we return unauthorized error
    - IF SO, we compare passwords using bcryptjs
      - IF they DON'T MATCH we send unauthorized error
      - IF THEY MATCH we send back the response with the token included -- userSchema.methods.createToken
        - access token
        - refresh token
        - cookie

* User logout
  - If cookies don't contain cookie?
    - No , all good
    - Yes, find refresh token in the db
      - if not found? all good
      - if found
        - delete refresh token from db
        - clear jwt token from the cookies
